Comment #1 -- Reddit Thread #,Comment Posted ,"OP, I’ve tried a few options myself. I found that looker isn't the best for embedded analytics tbh. Sigma’s pretty intuitive but not always the best fit if you’re dealing with a lot of SQL manipulation. One option I’ve been using and testing for just over a month is Qrvey. It’s built for SaaS applications and works well with AWS environments like your MySQL on RDS. I like that it combines data collection, transformation, and visualization without being overly complex. Plus, it’s been solid for embedding into our product without needing a ton of customization from scratch.","I've tried out some of the embedded analytics products within SaaS contexts. I didn't click with Looker as well as I might have hoped too complicated and not suited to more variable uses. Sigma was a little less difficult to get started with, but not so great when I had to make a lot of SQL changes. I've been recently working with Qrvey in AWS (RDS MySQL), and it's been great. I enjoy it since it does data collection, prep, and visualization all in one solution without having to build many things from scratch. It's not ideal, but it's worth trying if you're looking for something that's designed for SaaS deployment.",,,
Comment #2,Comment Posted ,"Just seen someone mentioning Qrvey for embedded analytics for SaaS deployment, and I second that too.

We initially planned on building our own embedded analytics, but decided to outsource, and have been using qrvey for that. Overall, we are happy, and it saved us a ton of headache with developing this in house",,,,
Comment #3,Comment To Modify (External),"If you're embedding into a SaaS app and want tight control over RLS, SSO, and filters without tons of custom code, Qrvey’s (and possibly Luzmo, but never tried them personally) are worth a look. Built for embedded use and plays nicely with MySQL on RDS. Lightweight but checks a lot of the right boxes.",,,,
Comment #4,Comment To Modify (External),"We tested Sigma, Explo, Qrvey and Metabase. each has strengths, but Qrvey stood out for embedded use the most. It's built for multi-tenant SaaS, and unlike Sigma or Explo, it handles data prep, visualization, and automation all in one platform. No extra tools or stitching things together, which made life easier for our dev team.",,,,
Comment #1,Comment To Post (External),"If you end up wanting something a little more structured down the line (like tracking who used what + light reporting), One Step GPS has a super simple setup and no lock in contracts. Not self-hosted though. For pure booking, LibreBooking or 365 resources sounds like a good low-friction start.","We had the same setup where I used to work. We initially just used a team Google Sheet or Calendar where individuals would mark down if they wanted a car. It was okay but got confusing if there were many individuals who wanted the same car.

We also took a look at some tools subsequently that would assist us in tracking. They are mostly web based and not self hosted. One Step GPS was what my colleague mentioned it is mostly vehicle tracking but can be used to assist in booking as well. It would be nice if you prefer things to be easy.

If you prefer something that you can serve yourself, you may be able to find a straightforward open-source solution on GitHub.",,,
Comment #2,Comment Posted ,"We started with Office 365 resource calendars too.  But eventually needed a bit more accountability (who drove what, when, mileage, etc). Switched to One Step GPS, mostly because it was plug-and-play and didn't make our IT guy cry. No fluff, just works.","We started with Office 365 resource calendars too.

Comment #1 -- Reddit Thread #,Comment In Up Voting (External),"It is hard to keep all the pieces together between the site, retail, and Amazon without having some kind of system. Having SKUs standardized helped a lot; it is hard to get used to at first, but connecting the sites becomes very easy. We began by printing our own barcodes with a label printer, which really tightened up our organization. Select multi location tracking with Shopify and Amazon apps. There are apps that link multiple SKUs to one product, and that could be valuable to you. I selected Korona POS since it is easy to handle various sales channels and inventory. It may be appropriate for you. Stay with it it's daunting but the proper system has you doing it in no time.","It is hard to keep all the pieces together between the site, retail, and Amazon without having some kind of system.

Comment #2 -- Reddit Thread ,Comment To Modify (External),"I'm with Korona, and use their inventory features for pretty much all of your use-cases too. Multi-store, e-commerce and barcodes. Not sure about the multiple SKUs but I've not had to dive into that for our biz. There hasn't been a single thing their support team hasn't been able to sort for me though, yet. They're a lovely bunch and available 24 hours..night and day from my old POS and inventory company who I wasted an insane amount of time chasing if I had an issue. Honestly, I couldn't do inventory without them at this point. I figured our cases were too complicated for a solution to handle, but they've been amazing for us as non-techies.

Comment #3 -- Reddit Thread,Comment Posted ,"Yeah we eventually needed advanced inventory and started with Square to manage our multi-store and multi-channel inventory, but man, they take the p*** out of you after a while. Constant fee rises, dead support. They've become too big for their own boots. Definitely DON'T go with them. I hear not so great things about Clover too. My advice would be to look at reviews not just for the features you need but also things like outages, support etc. I've switched to KoronaPOS who are night and day in support and handles our advanced inventory management synced between stores and our online channels. But do your research for your industry. I'm sure you'll find a solution that specializes. Worst thing is to go for a general solution like Square/Clover imo","Yeah we eventually needed advanced inventory and started with Square to manage our multi-store and multi-channel inventory, but man, they take the p*** out of you after a while.

Comment #1 -- Reddit Thread #,Comment In Up Voting (External),"i ran a small family shop for a few years, and finding a good PoS system was way harder than I expected. I’d say look for something simple to use but still gives you solid reporting and inventory control. We tried a few, but Korona POS ended up working well for us because it didn’t feel bloated, and their support was actually helpful when we needed it. Might be worth checking out, depending on what kind of products you’re selling.","I used to run a small family shop, and honestly, finding a decent PoS system was way tougher than I thought.

Comment #2 -- Reddit Thread,Comment Posted ,"Totally agree with top comment on Clover. Just do a Google search on reports of them witholding funds for zero rhyme or reason. Complete dealbreaker and a small business killer. Mine wouldn't survive. I looked through a few of the typical big players initially, Clover, Square, Lightspeed..either too expensive (or hit you with backend payment processor fees) or bad reviews. Landed on Koronapos for our c-store in the end due to the fact it was pretty simple to use and I liked that their sales rep wasn't sleazy honestly lol. But it has all the bells and whistles if you need them. We use it mostly for POS and inventory. Worked great for years now.","Totally agree with top comment on Clover.

Comment #3 -- Reddit Thread,Comment To Modify (External),We use Korona for our cstore. Happy with it. I'm an old gen X'er who hates technology and their support gets that. I've probably annoyed them more than my monthly subscription is worth but they're great. Helps they're 24/7 too which was what swung the decision for me since we close late. Its got everything we need to run the store smoothly. ,,,,
Comment #4 -- Reddit Thread,Comment To Modify (External),"Just don't use Square whatever you do! If you have an issue they'll give you the runaround and if you're lucky you'll get through before your customers have left you 10 x 1* star reviews on Google. Painful experience for us and glad we got far away from them. Have a look at some of the independent review sites and choose what features you need most vs price/value and support. Korona seemed the best fit for us and has worked well in our store for 4 years so far, but all have their pros and cons. ",,,,
Comment #1 -- Reddit Thread #,Comment In Up Voting (External),I've worked in retail for a couple of years and had a couple of POS systems.

Comment #2 -- Reddit Thread,Comment Posted ,"Sorry to the dude who works at Square but wouldn't touch them if they were the last POS on earth. Support non-existent. Fee rises whenever they fancy it. You're just a number to them. Lightspeed is expensive imo for what it is. Depends on what you need and value though. I have 3 stores so need advanced inventory for a few locations and ecomm integration too. Switched to Korona from Square which I wish I did sooner (the dread of starting over with an unfamiliar system). Their support team are amazing. Held my hand through the whole transition and set me up. Works a dream. Not as pretty looking as Square, but all the functionality and importantly, they actually care about customers! Good luck.

Comment #3 -- Reddit Thread,Comment To Modify (External),"Korona POS. Been perfect for my smoke shop. Handles inventory well, CRM, loyalty programs, analytics/reports. Does multi-location. Doesn't lock you into an expensive payment processor too, so you can choose your own and keep more of your hard-earned. No complaints so far.

Comment #1 -- Reddit Thread #,Comment In Up Voting (External),"In fact, printing two receipts at once is a genuine wastage one that we've experienced firsthand. In the end we turned some of the settings back to keep it to a bare minimum, though not all systems are so. What I've learned is that the perfect POS really just depends upon how much control the owner wants. At a friend's coffee house they switched to Korona POS mainly because it let them very finely tune a number of different things. It's perhaps worth looking into if you ever look at other options.","In fact, printing two receipts at once is a genuine wastage one that we've experienced firsthand.

Comment #2 -- Reddit Thread,Comment Posted ,"Agree with those saying Square and Lightspeed the worst. Personal experience with Square here and their support absolutely sucks when things go wrong. Lightspeed just silly expensive. What happens when companies get too big and corporate and stop caring about the little man. Looked into Toast but settled on KoronaPOS in the end. Got a great vibe from their team and happy so far. Support has been on point and it's working well so far. Handles loyalty discounts for our cafe, inventory (you can even automate it when stock gets low etc). Loads of options. Took me a while to get used to but it's super easy now.

Comment #3 -- Reddit Thread,Comment To Modify (External),"I shopped around a fair bit when looking for our coffee shop. Wanted something simple, fairly cheap (starting the biz with my savings) and just worked. Looked at Toast, Loyverse and KoronaPOS..the free part of Loyverse obviously attracted me but nothing is free in this world. They have paid add-ons that are included in other subscriptions. Works out the same in the end. Thing that made me go with Korona in the end was the fact they don't make sleazy money from my business with high payment processing rates and they let me choose a processor that was best value for me. Appreciated that and it does the job well for my coffee shop. All the features I need and 24/7 support for technophobes like me lol",,,,
Comment #4 -- Reddit Thread,Comment To Modify (External),"Be careful with Clover. I was about to pull the trigger on their POS but saw wayyy too many reports of them witholding funds for no apparent reason. My business wouldn't survive that. Complete dealbreaker. Ended up going with Koronapos. It's pretty simple but you can make it as complicated as you like as they have all the bells and whistles with multi-location store options, advanced inventory etc. For us, we use the pos, loyalty feature, inventory management and alerts and I look at their reports for fun every so often - or sometimes not fun when we've had a bad month lol. Their 24 hour support team are lovely too. ",,,,
Comment #1 -- Reddit Thread #,Comment Posted ,"Yes, this would make sense, actually. I've had individuals tell me that microneedling before applying the creams makes them penetrate more. I'm in my 40s and have used copper peptides myself, too I did experience some odd sagging and was thinking I was just worrying too much, but now I'm not so certain. It's annoying when we want to tighten it up, not the other way around, haha. The only thing that I did find to work was NAD+ injections. I did them at home after purchasing them online (I believe it was from IvyRx). My skin was really smooth and looked like it had a healthy glow. I'm not saying it's a miracle, but it worked for me. I would wonder if NAD+ would undo the effects of copper peptides.","Yes, this would make sense, actually.

Comment #2 -- Reddit Thread,Comment To Modify (External),"Only thing I can think of reverse this quickly is increasing growth hormone production which is essential for synthesizing collagen. Doubt any doc would prescribe you hgh for this reason tho, but you could go for a secretagogue (basically something induces a natural increase in GH in your body). I use Sermorelin injections at home myself from ivyrx and my skin has never looked tighter a month or so in. Sorry you had to go through that :( ",,,,
Comment #3 -- Reddit Thread,Comment To Modify (External),"Honestly why we need to do research before jumping on any new fad that reportedly helps our skin...the largest organ on our body! I wouldn't screw with it until I know all possible sides. Only thing that's had a noticeable effect on my skin has been retinol, botox and sermorelin injections. I didn't get sermorelin for my skin, but it has been a very welcome side effect. Only found out after that it's great for natural collagen production for skin elasticity. Needs a prescription but a few telehealth services do them after a medical consult. Got mine from IvyRx and they've been alright so far. Hope your skin is back to normal now!",,,,
Comment #4 -- Reddit Thread,Comment To Modify (External),"As a poster mentioned on this thread already suggested, get on a growth hormone secretagogue asap if this has happened to you. Fixed my out of control jowls in about 4 months! Tesamorelin, Ipamorelin, Sermorelin..take your pick and get your collagen production up pronto. I went the Sermorelin route since it's the one that felt the most natural to me but they all work. Worked a charm and wouldn't go back. I'm on subscription with IvyRx and they just send mine out monthly. Wouldn't touch copper peptides with a 20 foot pole! Heard this way too often.",,,,

Comment #1 -- Reddit Thread #,Comment Posted ,"I feel you on the pfSense pain points, especially in a virtualized setup. If you're specifically looking for a Linux-based firewall OS with a decent GUI and solid feature set, I'd say give OPNsense a look. It’s BSD-based like pfSense, but the UI is more modern, and the community support is solid. If BSD is a dealbreaker, though, check out IPFire, lightweight, Linux-based, and pretty user-friendly for a firewall. Another one worth considering is ClearOS - it’s Linux-based, has a nice GUI, and offers enterprise-level features. One more thing, if you’re planning on deploying this in a business environment and want to keep security top-notch, make sure to set up automated patching. I use TuxCare for live patching on my Linux servers, keeps the firewall secure without needing reboots, which is crucial for uptime.

One thing I’ve found helpful is combining a few sources rather than sticking to one video. There’s a solid checklist on CyberCiti that covers a bunch of essentials, plus a few GitHub repos that automate parts of the hardening process. Also, if you’re looking to automate patch management and make your server more resilient, definitely check out TuxCare. They’ve got some legit solutions for automated live patching and vulnerability management – no downtime, which is pretty clutch for keeping things secure without breaking stuff. Not exactly a guide, but if you’re aiming for hands-off hardening and maintenance, it’s worth a look.","I completely understand you, OP. Locking down a Linux server can be difficult at times. I've also learned a lot of guides and, sure, the basics like turning off the default admin account, SSH keys, and UFW on are really crucial. One thing that has worked for me is having multiple sources instead of one video. There's a good checklist at CyberCiti that has a lot of the crucial info, and also a couple of GitHub repositories that automate some of the process of locking down the server. If you need to automate hardening and patch management of your server, then you should give TuxCare a try. They provide decent solutions to automatic live patching and vulnerability management no downtime, which is a big relief to maintain things secure without disrupting things. It's not really a guide, but if you need easy hardening and maintenance, then it's worth a try.",,,
Comment #2,Comment To Check (Scalerrs),"I like using a combo of CIS Benchmarks + OpenSCAP or Lynis for the initial hardening phase. But honestly, hardening is only part of the battle—keeping things patched without breaking uptime is where people often drop the ball.

For that, live patching is a game changer. We’ve had good success with TuxCare, it handles kernel and other patching automatically, no reboots, no downtime. Great for avoiding CVEs creeping in between maintenance windows. Worth considering if you're managing prod-facing systems.",I usually start off with a mix of CIS Benchmarks and something like OpenSCAP or Lynis to lock things down at the start. But honestly that’s just step one. The real challenge is keeping stuff patched without messing up uptime people slip up there a lot. That’s where live patching really helps. We’ve been using TuxCare and it’s been solid. It takes care of kernel patches and all that stuff automatically no need to reboot or take anything offline. Super handy for avoiding those CVEs sneaking in between updates. Definitely worth checking out if you're running systems in production.,,,
Comment #3,Comment To Modify (External),"I’ve been down the road with tools like OpenSCAP and Ansible roles from dev-sec—both are great for initial hardening. CIS Benchmarks are solid too, though a bit tedious to fully implement manually.

For keeping servers secure after hardening, I’ve tried Canonical Livepatch and KernelCare (from CloudLinux), but I’ve found TuxCare to be more flexible, especially when managing mixed environments. Their live patching works on most major distros and covers more than just the kernel, which is a huge plus. Definitely helps avoid those “we’ll patch it next maintenance window” risks.",,,,
Comment #1 -- Reddit Thread #,Comment Posted ,"I’ve used both Looker and Sisense for embedded analytics in SaaS apps, and they each have their strengths. Looker is great for more complex data modeling and has pretty solid embedding options, but it’s definitely on the pricier side. Sisense is strong for multi-tenancy and RLS, but yeah, the UI customization is pretty limited, kind of a pain iin the neck f you want something more visually polished. We were pitched Qrvey as an alternative at a conference a while back. It’s designed specifically for SaaS apps, so embedding and customization are built-in rather than feeling like afterthoughts. Plus, it’s AWS-native, which makes integration smoother if you’re already on that stack. Multitenancy, SSO, and role-based access are pretty straightforward, and the visualization options are a bit more flexible compared to Sisense. We ended up giving it go after watching the demo and speaking to the team. It's pretty solid tbh, and pricing is good.","I have experience with Sisense and Looker embedded analytics. Based on what you've said, Sisense is better at handling filters without additional engineering effort. Users can save their own filters and they are the same when they return, which Sisense does very well. Looker has more control but tends to need more engineering effort particularly with LookML and embedding. If you don't want to be forced to create custom filter tools or work with a lot of details manually you should consider Qrvey. It is designed for embedded use and works well with RLS and multi tenant scenarios without needing a lot of extra development effort. This is something you might want to consider if you want something that gets better over time.",,,
Comment #2 -- Reddit Thread ,Comment Posted ,,"I have worked with both Sisense and Looker for embedded analytics in a SaaS application. If saving filters by user and RLS are high priorities, Sisense can feel that much more flexible, particularly for allowing even simple users to return to their dashboard with filters intact. Looker is great at RLS, but making saved filters stick tends to involve some additional work on your application side. We tried Qrvey a while back. It is more geared towards being used easily elsewhere, so things such as multitenancy and filter memory function better. It really just depends on how you're set up with technology, but it might be worth a shot if Looker or Sisense feels too limiting.",,,

Was a smoother setup for us than either Sisense or Looker.",,,,

Comment #2 -- Reddit Thread ,Comment To Modify (External),"Agree with other comments, the two things aren't mutually exclusive. Personally use both but NAD+ more for focus and fatigue and it works very well for that in my experience. Wouldn't bother with IV though. Tried that once and it was hella expensive. Was weird feeling too, got this immediate euphoria which then subsided pretty quick and I got pretty mad focus for about 4-5 days. Cheaper way for me was subQ at-home injections. Got mine from ivyrx and the effects last longer for me than IV. My body aches and pains are infinitely better on it.

Comment #3 -- Reddit Thread,Comment To Modify (External),"Wherever you went is looking to make a quick buck out of you. Especially with how often they recommend IV infusions of NAD, you're looking at like $1000+ monthly. It's good and makes my body feel great at 40+ but I do the at-home injections from Ivyrx. Much cheaper and makes it worth it. IV's would be well out of my price range otherwise. ",,,,

Comment #2 -- Reddit Thread,Comment To Post (External),"My personal experience: wanted Ozempic to work really bad..I just couldn't deal with the sides. Nausea, headaches and I just couldn't shake them no matter how many weeks I persisted. Gutted because I have friends who had the best results and barely any sides. I switched to Sermorelin (got it from IvyRx who sorted my prescription after a consultation) which basically makes your body naturally increase growth hormone output and I've had zero sides so far and steadily lost fat. Really ramped up after about week 6. It's probably a bit slower than Ozempic but it makes me feel so much better. As a bonus, my skin also looks great!

Comment #3 -- Reddit Thread ,Comment To Post (External),"It sucked for me, sadly. Was so excited but the sides were just too much. I started losing hair (which was an immediate no-no!) and the diarhea..well, less I say the better just in case you're eating! Switched to Tirzepatide but that was similar for me. Contacted my telehealth service for advice (Ivyrx) and the doctor switched me in the end to Sermorelin but did say I'd need a little more patience. He was right - it takes more time to see the results of your body naturally increasing growth hormone slowly but after 3 months I look and feel like a different person. Skin, energy and weight loss. Would never go back to GLP's personally. Just know, you're not alone if you do get these symptoms and don't give up

Comment #1 -- Reddit Thread #,Comment Posted ,"Totally agree with this list — I’ve made some of these mistakes myself early on.

Their work is more strategic, positioning, ICP alignment, and even identifying which channels will actually convert vs. look nice in a slide deck.
