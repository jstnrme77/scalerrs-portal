M
Mihkel Sinikas
00:23
All good. How about you? 
J
Jules Davies
00:24
Yeah, good, thanks. Back in Estonia? 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
00:27
Yeah, back in Estonia, Yeah. 
J
Jules Davies
00:32
What's the temperature like at the moment? 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
00:34
Sorry? 
J
Jules Davies
00:35
What's the temperature like at the moment these days out there? 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
00:39
Sorry, I didn't get that. 
J
Jules Davies
00:40
Sorry. What's the temperature like in terms of like weather and all? Is it good or. Not really. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
00:46
So it's like 10 degrees. So it's like chilly. 
J
Jules Davies
00:52
It's maybe it's 10 degrees. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
00:55
How about you? You're in, you're in south of France, right? 
J
Jules Davies
00:57
Yeah, correct. It's around the 20s now, so it's quite nice. It's got much better. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
01:02
Sure. Hey, how is it in the summer? You probably don't have like an aircon or something, right? 
J
Jules Davies
01:08
Yeah, I do have a video. 
J
Jules Davies
01:09
Hey Kim. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
01:11
Okay. 
J
Jules Davies
01:11
It's like in the summer it's like between 25 to like 35 and like some peak days at 40, but it's sort of like one week out of the year, I'd say. But the thing is of the south of France, where I am the west, so Kim is originally from the east, which is much drier. My side is very humid, which means the heat, you feel it very quick compared to the east which is very dry. So. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
01:32
Yeah, yeah, I was there like two years ago and like I. I couldn't work like for a single minute on. 
J
Jules Davies
01:38
The east or the west? 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
01:40
No, south. Like in San Trope it was, it was so hot that like I was just. I think it's just Estonian thing. Like we're so used to the cold, so. 
K
Kimberley Hamon
01:50
Yeah, I don't think so. I think like, you know, in Dubai we have AC everywhere. So we used to like being in the ac. And when I go to Europe I'm like the is wrong with people not having ac? Like it's so hot. I can't believe we did so many summers with like no AC in my parents house. Like I don't know how it works. 
J
Jules Davies
02:14
Yeah, I get that. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
02:16
So yeah, for working it does, it's essential. But if you're just like chilling then it's okay. But that work is completely impossible to do like without like, I don't know, like 20, 21 degrees. It's crazy. 
J
Jules Davies
02:31
I agree. All right, awesome stuff. All right guys. Mike, we get some feedback on the portal. Overall like really good job in terms of like great start. I really appreciate all the work been done. So I just want to say that in terms of like overall going in a great direction, I guess. Look, we've jotted down some thoughts. That's what you want to talk about, right? On this call today, I'm probably guessing. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
02:52
Yeah, yeah, I took a look at some of them already and I agree with a lot of them as well. Like some pages, I guess like my initial comment as well is that I guess there for some pages there is like a lot of information. So, so I would maybe even cut down like some elements to just condense it a little bit. But yeah, we can go over it. 
J
Jules Davies
03:16
Cool. 
J
Jules Davies
03:17
Well there's two solutions. 
K
Kimberley Hamon
03:18
Yeah, sorry, do we have to go through the whole document? 
J
Jules Davies
03:21
Because that's what I was going to say. So how about we do this, Mike? So if you can see my screen. But how about you go over the document, I mean just to record a loom on the document in terms of like the ideas or does it all work to be self explanatory? Not really. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
03:39
I would say maybe let's go over some specific details which are not clear. 
J
Jules Davies
03:44
Okay. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
03:45
Which I think. 
J
Jules Davies
03:46
Yeah, okay. So gone I would say the main stuff which is like talkable stuff for today which we productive would probably be the report section and maybe the KPI Dashboard and the SEO layouts. I mean Kim, do you have other stuff in mind? But I'm thinking that's probably where the big interest is. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
04:04
Yeah, recording reporting and KPI Dashboard is probably going to be the one where there's like a lot of details. Details. So, so we could go over that. I mean in terms of the other pages it's quite straightforward in my opinion. So there's some elements that we need to still add and some kind of condensing that we need to do. But I think the reports page and the analytics page is probably the one where there's more to discuss. 
J
Jules Davies
04:30
Kim, do you agree? Would you have extra pages in mind, Kim? 
K
Kimberley Hamon
04:34
No, because I wasn't sure that the reports and the KPI dashboard was actually the focus today. Because we still need to do more work internally to think about what data needs to go in. 
J
Jules Davies
04:57
Yeah, so I looked last night to be honest and I basically did what? Sure. We can't basically Mike, went over yesterday with Kim and like is there enough information here for actually our reports, etc. I went over what was there and then sort of like mapped up what we had in mind and just like on what was there I already had some feedback in terms of like what we could do better. So for example like the monthly report here I go to it. There's the average keyword position. That wouldn't be very helpful, to be honest, for us. I think we could just leave it out. I think it's down here again later on. It's somewhere so here. So we could remove that one out as well. So stuff like this. 
J
Jules Davies
05:39
I had a few comments, but yeah, we could indeed, if you want to, Kim, just double check internally. But like, in hindsight, I had a few comments basically on this. I mean, is there anything else you could be doing differently here, Mike, you think, which we've missed ourselves or. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
05:57
Yeah, it's a good question. I would say that probably if you go to the top. So yeah, we have the walkthrough. So we have the TLDR at the top. Right. And then channel performance. 
K
Kimberley Hamon
06:12
Now we have the executive summary, then the loom, then the charts, the deltas and all that stuff. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
06:21
Yeah, so. So the executive summary is actually like the TL should be the tldr. So. 
J
Jules Davies
06:27
Yeah, right. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
06:28
Yeah. 
J
Jules Davies
06:28
I was thinking for the executive summer and stuff like this, like, I put a comment on the courtesy report, but I was just saying, like, it needs another design just in terms of information because I think the next time we speak, like, more bullet point focused. So I think that's like a design thingy in terms of, like, how does it look? And then also, like, we have one question, Kim, is how can we potentially just break up maybe the sections a little bit? That's possible in terms of like trying to show like this executive summary. This is the performance trends. You're trapping revenue. Yeah, we're wondering if that's possible as well. But it's been. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
06:59
So question what we could do. And what I think is better in terms of usability would be to actually collapse all of the sections and just leave the first graphs and then leave the executive summary. And then. Well, basically, like how it should be structured is that you have like different data points that are supporting your arguments. So for example, you have the performance trends, keywords, whatever. And then like the takeaways from all of these graphs should come into the executive summary. So you basically just summarize like the data in one sentence, like for all of the sections. And then when a person actually wants to go into that data and see like, what's going on, then they would open up that. That section. So basically they should get all their information from the executive summary. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
07:48
And then all the other supporting information comes, like, at the bottom. So basically you could have different sections that you want to show. So for example, let's say keyword performance, traffic, performance These different sections. You have an executive summary bullet for each of these sections. And then maybe you could expand on the point below that chart, for example, so you write a little bit more than you do, for example, in the executive summary. That's how I would structure it, maybe to give more insight into the data. Because data is one thing, but then there probably has to be also some context surrounding it. So you could have the summary one bullet point for each section and then beneath the graphs or the data that is being shown, you elaborate on the data. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
08:42
But that depends also like how much you actually want to do in terms of the writing part for the senior SEO. So that's up to you, but that's how I would. 
J
Jules Davies
08:54
Yeah, that makes sense. So in other words, class tool sections, just a little bit more sense. Yeah. 
J
Jules Davies
08:58
Okay, cool. 
J
Jules Davies
08:59
I mean that makes sense. 
K
Kimberley Hamon
09:01
That would help a lot, I think in visually. 
J
Jules Davies
09:04
Yeah, that help a lot. 
J
Jules Davies
09:06
I'd say definitely. I like the idea of that. Yeah, that sounds pretty cool. So one extra question I had is also like, let's say for some of these. That one, it was a general question which we had across the board. Like, let's say we don't have. Let's say we don't have the data for every single possible thing if every single client. Like leads generated, for example, revenue impact. These are two metrics we don't often have for clients because of tracking issues they have. And just like. Also you can think about attribution in terms of like, it's not all. That's your just drives. The last result, last conversion. How would that work in terms of like on a report, we're just blank. Will there be nothing? Can we hide it on a per client basis? This like some type of option. 
J
Jules Davies
09:52
How does it work roughly? 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
09:53
So we could potentially hide it. But I guess the thinking behind it was that if you're able to generate like x amount of leads from specific amounts of traffic. So for some clients who have the tracking in place, that would be the actual figure. And for the clients that don't have the tracking in place, we could put like a disclaimer that based on like your, like based on your estimate or based on what we've seen from the data, this is like how many leads you are generating like per visitor. So like an estimate more so not like an actual hard figure. And then you also do the revenue impact which we discussed a couple of calls ago, which would be like you take the average. 
K
Kimberley Hamon
10:36
I forgot. No, you're right. 
J
Jules Davies
10:37
Yeah, yeah. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
10:38
So you take the. So you take the Average revenue per visit sitter. And you kind of like, try to, or should I say you try to, I guess, reverse engineer the actual revenue and you show like, this is the estimated revenue that we're actually generating with the SEO activities. So. So I would still keep it in because I think it's a really important metric for clients, especially because it all comes down to, like, money at the end of the day. So I think it's important to show it even though it's like an estimate, because I think your principle as well, like how you're reverse engineering it is from like the revenue perspective. 
J
Jules Davies
11:13
Right. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
11:13
Or the, like the leads perspective. So I think it would be good to show it in any case. 
J
Jules Davies
11:19
Okay. It's a question and so gone. So it's manual, right? So we put in the leads manual. It's absolutely fine. So putting leads manually. But, like, are you saying to like, ask the client roughly how many leads they had or you simple trying to. Simply trying to say, like, ask them roughly how many leads they generate per month and like, what the value of the leads are. And then depending on the traffic value, the traffic amounts, which we're saying to the clients, we just sort of like reverse engineer roughly which one was it? Sorry, Mike. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
11:42
Yeah, so I would do. I would do it as a percentage. So from the traffic you generate, like take a percentage and then you get the lead, like the count of leads. And then from the estimated average revenue per user or average revenue per visitor, you would reverse engineer the revenue, Basically. But the disclaimer. But we would. In addition, we would need to add there that this is like disclaimer. This is like an estimated figure based on like, the. The numbers we have estimate. 
K
Kimberley Hamon
12:17
So we're using basically the industry average for conversion and saying that this is the percentage. This is the number that we're using for the percentage. Or we are actually asking the client for the lead. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
12:31
Yeah, yeah, so. So I would get that information either from the onboarding form or if you can, like, ask them, actually, that would better. So they should definitely have some kind of estimate for it. Even though it's a rough estimate. Yeah. 
J
Jules Davies
12:48
Okay, cool. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
12:49
Because in Google Analytics, it's still. 
J
Jules Davies
12:54
Easy. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
12:54
To differentiate the organic traffic. Right? So how much is organic traffic? And also, I guess it depends, like how their conversion is set up, but they should still be able to roughly estimate, like, how many leads they've generated from SEO or no, like, signups. 
J
Jules Davies
13:13
Yeah, roughly, I guess you could say. 
J
Jules Davies
13:16
Okay, cool. 
J
Jules Davies
13:17
So. Okay, cool, that makes sense then. So basically all of that then every single field here which has leads then would be tied back to that manual process. Right. Is that correct? 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
13:27
Exactly. Yeah. 
J
Jules Davies
13:28
Okay, cool. 
J
Jules Davies
13:29
So that'll be a field in the backend which is filled in manually. 
J
Jules Davies
13:32
Right. 
J
Jules Davies
13:32
By the seniors or myself, for example, the head of SEO, whatever the percentage. 
J
Jules Davies
13:37
Yeah. Okay, cool. 
J
Jules Davies
13:40
All right, so for example, if you. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
13:43
Do your own estimations, then how do you do it? Do you only do it for clients that actually have the conversion tracking in place or. 
J
Jules Davies
13:50
Try to be honest, I don't want to have to know tracking in place, which is nice, good behavior. It's just what we do for now. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
13:59
Yeah, I just think tying it to a specific revenue figure is like a reasonable thing to do. Even though it's an estimation. 
J
Jules Davies
14:07
Yeah. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
14:07
Because you're kind of. 
J
Jules Davies
14:09
Yeah, I agree. 
J
Jules Davies
14:10
100. Okay, cool. I mean. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
14:15
So if you're asking, for example, something that you could also include is like the ROI on the retainer of the client and then dividing it by the revenue generated. 
J
Jules Davies
14:28
Yeah. 
J
Jules Davies
14:28
But then that's actually one filter which I actually had in the past I took out because that same idea, the revenue wasn't actually calculated. But if we could do it, actually that'd be very good actually. ROI on retainer. That way it's always top of mind. So like a figure, right, of like one to whatever it is, basically. 
J
Jules Davies
14:44
Yeah. 
J
Jules Davies
14:45
Ryan Retainer. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
14:46
Sure. 
J
Jules Davies
14:46
Up top. And I was thinking, but like this should probably be shown. Show up top. Probably show it for both the monthly and the quarterly. So like here, the same way you've got your metrics basically up here, your traffic growth, the generated revenue impact, etc, you should probably have that on the monthly one as well because in hindsight it's probably the same types of. Of data. Right. In terms of like. Yeah, I think it's much more hard to show that one. So I'd probably put that on the monthly as well. Does that sound good? 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
15:13
Yep. 
J
Jules Davies
15:15
And then one extra data point I was going to say to add as well would probably be the one you've got down here is a CPC equivalence. I probably put that on top of mind as well. So the same way, actually you probably got your data points here basically the same way you've got them over here on the side. I think I prefer this one for top of page better. But we could probably also add, if that's okay, the CPC equivalence because it also helps benchmark roughly, and it's very easy to do but say to yourself like, okay, roughly how much that traffic equal to my traffic equals X amount Basically, so up in that we have causal. 
J
Jules Davies
15:45
We could do that. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
15:47
And that's. That's the figure you pull anyways from Ahrefs, right across. 
J
Jules Davies
15:52
Yeah, correct. Exactly. Yeah. So all you need to do is you need to have the clicks, basically, which Ahrefs pulls through in terms of how much you, how many clicks is your URL getting. And after it doesn't pull, it can pull through the CPC equivalence of the keyword. If not, you just import it. When you import the keyword manually, just put CPC equivalence of the keyword. And that way it's just. You just do a calculation on a base screen. It's very simple. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
16:16
One, One disclaimer for the monthly report, though, is like, if. If it's like the first or second month and the SEO results haven't really kicked in, the ROI might kind of backfire. So quarterly would better, I would suggest, but depends, like, kind of how you see. Okay, so if the client is in their, like, first or second month, they're still like, ramping up SEO then? I don't know. It depends how much traffic you generate. 
J
Jules Davies
16:44
So, I mean, that's true. Could you hide it for the first two months? We wanted to. Could there be, like, some type of option to hide it or not really. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
16:56
Yeah, depends. Depends if the client's gonna ask for it. Like, for example, if you have it for, like, the third month. 
J
Jules Davies
17:04
Because even quarterly sometimes, you don't always have the ROI on the quarterly. Because SEO can kick in like month four, month five sometimes. So it won't always be directly on the quarterly as well. So maybe put on his bracket marks, like, you know, should we always show. 
J
Jules Davies
17:27
Okay, cool. 
J
Jules Davies
17:28
Well, anything else you think we're missing here from our monthly and quarterly reports, roughly, or. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
17:37
I don't think so. So the keyword positions, you wanna take those out as well that we had on the graph. 
J
Jules Davies
17:45
This one here, average QR position. Not this one. This one's helpful to a degree because it's like, how many keywords you got in the top three, how many killers you got in the position for? It's just the average QO position. Because the average QO position doesn't really tell you much in terms of, like, if it goes up to 40 or what? It's not really super helpful. This is helpful because it's like, okay, how many more Qs you got in top three, how many more Qs you got? Position four as it's dropped, et cetera. Like, this is helpful, but this one here isn't very helpful. So this one here, the average keyword position but not the actual keyword trend. Does that make sense? Okay, yeah, that's also this one as well. Average keyword position, current visibility versus competition. Not super. 
J
Jules Davies
18:20
I personally think the most interesting. But if you want to make this interesting, you'd have to do for example, the top three versus the top three of the competition. But I'd say as a whole, just read it out and just makes it life easier basically. Okay, so yeah, I would do that and then I did add a few extra things basically. But like time to go. Yeah, I was going to say maybe on certain sections, the way you've done it here is you've added like little icons for like wins and cautions. I think it makes the design of the report much better. So I'd also do that for every single probably like section. And you guys are going to do the toggle, but probably add like a little icon in front of the title. 
J
Jules Davies
19:00
It just makes everything a little bit flow a little bit better. So you got a little icon here. I think it just makes the design of the page look a little bit better, personally. I'll try to do that. And after I would separate out potentially these two sections here because I think in terms of like crammed information looks a little bit too crammed. I'd put like wins, like fully take all the width and after just below the cautions, take all the width as well. Basically. That's personally the way I do it. I think it'd probably be a little bit easier to. To read and digest personally. Maybe same here for recommendations and next steps. Probably same story. And then let's have a look. I was gonna say for certain stuff, right? 
J
Jules Davies
19:41
Like let's say, I mean here obviously you've got channel performance in terms of like what I would recommend though is I wouldn't probably put the yellow. I'd probably put another color. I'd probably put like the pink for example we have or the green or whatever you want. But maybe also not actually have the impressions actually on channel performance because impressions is a bit of an. 
J
Jules Davies
20:08
To be very open. 
J
Jules Davies
20:10
So I'd say. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
20:14
Just leave clicks. 
J
Jules Davies
20:16
Yeah, just leave clicks because the other one's really the best metric to follow. So remove the click, remove the impressions and then we can add the clicks in. But that's fine. And yeah, and I guess after we can just double check through Kim if there's anything else which is missing here, which we definitely want to add. But I was going to say on the compester Intel. It would be good I would say to instead of like trying to do this here like technical SEO rank change compares to be like maybe like because it's not going to be on a keyword focus. Right. But compares to intel. The more the most thing suggesting to compare to intel is like okay, X competitor has grown by I don't know, 30 and we can see the traffic growth and we can clearly see there's going. 
J
Jules Davies
20:59
They're investing into SEO channel and we can say to ourselves okay, they're investing heavier. We've seen that they've actually started building up links a lot more quicker than us etc. So I would try and talk about this type of stuff there. So how could we. Is there a way to maybe simplify this and simply say like okay competitor a key takeaway is like a little box on the competitor and then have like a screenshot first thing. That's the way I would do it and probably remove the complexity here at the back end and simply have like a screenshot and key takeaways. Would that be possible or not really. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
21:29
So just remove the keyword focus and rank change then have the comment on the competitor activity and then potentially like a screenshot there to back up that. 
J
Jules Davies
21:39
Yeah, exactly. Well for example, I mean I don't know if you're going to have it showing on the report or not but like if you. It's going to be a field. But yeah, in other words compare a. Then add a few comments on the competitor and after a screenshot to support visually basically what we're talking about. If that makes sense. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
21:55
Yeah, I would maybe link the screenshot even so they can open it up. Otherwise it might not fit there. 
J
Jules Davies
22:02
True, that's a good point. Okay, well in that case if it's like a field you can link into and you can open up, that works. Yeah, sounds good. And yeah basically that was mainly my thoughts there in other words. But hey, we always come back to this later on in the future and but I think for now look let's those go through the action items I guess here on the last report and the quarterly in terms of these changes. But then after we can I think we can go this and then we can always come back to you Mike with some extra ideas if needed. What do you think Kim? That work? 
K
Kimberley Hamon
22:33
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. 
J
Jules Davies
22:35
Yeah. 
J
Jules Davies
22:36
Cool. 
J
Jules Davies
22:37
All right, sweet. Well, all right. That was me then on the. Sorry I can't see you guys but. 
K
Kimberley Hamon
22:44
I want to know about the onboarding form. That's the thing I'm Kind of worried about. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
22:51
Yeah, that was one of my questions as well is that right now you have the onboarding form inside Notion. So what we would actually propose is we can set up everything in fill out, which is the one that we discussed where they can collaboratively fill out the form, they can do it together. We can also make it branded. So we can basically just copy everything we have currently in notion, set it up and fill out and then connect it with airtable. So basically everything that is being filled out, you can see it also in airtable, which will also hook up to the portal. So that was one of my suggestions. Can set it up for you if that's okay with you. 
J
Jules Davies
23:38
Yep, that'd be sweet. So it's gonna be fill out. Yeah, correct. So we're gonna replace this and have that. 
J
Jules Davies
23:42
Yeah. 
J
Jules Davies
23:42
Awesome. 
K
Kimberley Hamon
23:43
It's off the, it's off platforms, it's off the customer portal. So that means that this section will just be a link to the fill out. Correct? 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
23:56
Yeah. And, and with the fill out form also like when we have the client created inside Airtable, then we can create special link for them in fill out where when they open it up it will be automatically connected to that client. So whenever they fill it out it will basically be connected inside their table. So you don't have to set up any kind of automation or anything like that to get the data in there. 
J
Jules Davies
24:24
Yep. Okay, cool. 
J
Jules Davies
24:25
That makes sense. Sweet. That works then. 
J
Jules Davies
24:27
Awesome. Perfect. Okay cool. 
J
Jules Davies
24:35
So anybody have any mind next big one to talk about. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
24:40
Me? 
J
Jules Davies
24:42
No. 
J
Jules Davies
24:42
Anybody? Oh, I got next one. Okay, I'll talk KPI. KPI Dashboard then. So I've got a few ideas. Overall it looks really good and like as a whole, I was just going to ask. Yeah, I was going to say can we hide certain things we wanted to but in Heinz, like let's say we wanted to hide SQL. Is it possible to hide on a 1.1 basis or same story if you're trying to find a way to fit it in? Or like we put zero if it's like na. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
25:07
I mean with hiding elements it's probably like a little bit more complex. I mean we can do it but I would keep it in just for the sake of like. Because the thing is that you'd want to know like which clients to do it for and which clients are not. 
J
Jules Davies
25:24
Doing it for sure. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
25:25
So you also have to make sure that the team knows exactly like which ones need to be filled out or not. So if you do it for everyone, then it's Kind of uniform. 
J
Jules Davies
25:34
Yeah. 
J
Jules Davies
25:34
Okay, cool. Okay, that's fine. That makes sense. I was going to say. So here on the KPI summary, you've done top page performance. So I know here on the side you've got breakdown by page type. Was that the goal of. Basically because I started here and I was like, oh, we've been cool to see like per page type, but was the goal of you separating is that everything per page type is here, basically? Is that correct? 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
25:57
Yep. 
J
Jules Davies
25:58
Okay, cool. So in that case, I can remove my comment. I was going to say same story. Maybe add icon potentially in certain sections to simplify the ui. So like keyword rankings, maybe have like little like keyword thingy top page performance. I mean there's like a con, maybe a whole across the whole portal just to add like a little icon in front. I think it makes it easier in the. Yeah. In the forecasting model then. So this is the only one which I was a little bit unsure of the design. So. Drum inside the airtable, maybe we talked about this. Maybe I've forgotten, but drum inside the airtable, this idea that you could basically see roughly like per month and per quarter. Exactly. Like what the milestones, what the traffic goals, et cetera, like what that generate for you. 
J
Jules Davies
26:38
So here, when we like using this, how can we, like there's no current way of seeing roughly the breakdown across the months across the year. So how did you see yourself, Mike? 
J
Jules Davies
26:49
Roughly this one. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
26:51
So you would keep a table in here or just a graph? 
J
Jules Davies
26:56
Well, a graph or a table, I think a graph is probably more helpful. But if you remember inside this one, let's just have a little look. This one we had a table, it was like, okay, we're right here, we're at this month now and we need to hit this, I need to hit that, I need to hit this error, etc, and it gives you like a rough idea of like what's the increase across the year. And if you were to put this into a graph, you'd have like a rough graph. So yeah, I would say like a graph would probably be helpful in terms of saying to yourself, okay, this is what we've got in mind in terms of the goals, basically. Like your thoughts. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
27:31
Okay, yeah, I mean we can replace the first one with the grab and then have the deliverables at the bottom. So it's like what is the gap and what we need to do to basically get on the same pace as the projections. 
J
Jules Davies
27:50
Okay. 
J
Jules Davies
27:53
Okay, cool. 
J
Jules Davies
27:54
Okay, that makes Sense, I mean, maybe. Yeah, okay, maybe this one needs to think about it. Me and Kim are better than I could say. Okay, cool. But otherwise this one here looks good, I think. 
J
Jules Davies
28:12
Yeah, okay, cool. 
J
Jules Davies
28:14
I guess an extra one on SEO layout. So just, I guess here we need to add more fields just as just like a small comment. We just need to add more fields in this one. I was going to say maybe the table, is it possible to have it scroll just a table instead of the whole page? Because it just makes the UI a little bit more usable in terms of that. That's possible, Mike. Probably a small detail. And then after I was going to say, so we need to get just a few extra views here, but I guess that's fine. So I was going to say an extra view for clusters. The client can see all their clusters and the articles that fit into each. And then I was going to say, so like here you've done product prune. How does it work? 
J
Jules Davies
28:50
Is this like, is this going to have to be pre set up already in the back end? Or like for example, can we create custom views share to clients now and then and they like they're modulable inside this view or how does it work roughly? Do you know? 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
29:05
So, so you would want to basically show like a custom view from airtable and just show these fields as you. 
J
Jules Davies
29:13
Do in airtable or that's the thing, right? So for example, in airtable the way we showed it was like, for example, the one you've just done right now is called product proving. Right. It's this one here. It was through in April, whatever. So idea being is like the senior had a specific need, had to show some specific data to the client and he just created this view and after shared it to the client. Right. So my question was can we do inside the portal? And like if we do inside the portal, is it possible to have like some type of view which is easy, customizable and that means that like every single time the senior has specific need to show something specific to the client. You can use this view inside the portal. If that's not possible, then it makes life complicated. 
J
Jules Davies
29:48
I mean, you know, there's a very simple workaround. Just basically show a public view of the airtable here, which we have in our back end and just you know, show it to the client and then there you go, you know, put them on read only. And then if it's like a really ad hoc new which arrives which comes up once every six months, in that case we just do that. I mean do you get what I'm coming from? 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
30:08
Yeah, I understand. I think what we could do is we could also embed the specific view in there. I'll have to check how is it like design wise but definitely can do. I'm just thinking how it will be with the elements. So with the embedding probably will be easier but I need to double check if we can do it like we have it right now. 
J
Jules Davies
30:32
Cool. 
J
Jules Davies
30:33
But that works for example. That works very well. I'll just like broadcast and view based thing. Okay, cool. That's what I had in mind. The SEO layouts tab. I mean all the rest after deliverables. I mean it's just a question of adding more fields most times and just like hiding a few stuff I guess. Yeah, just a big. Maybe just one more important just on the CRO stuff in terms of like taskboard. So the thing is on the CRO1 I think it's possible but like the same way inside Airtable if you went to the CRO tab you had like all the examples of the action items like this, all these tags here and you had like the screenshot example that also needs to be inside the portal. So this field here basically inside it needs to be like the example of the. 
J
Jules Davies
31:14
The action item basically to be done by the client. Like this is like a CRO thing just to support the idea. Hey, like social group is like logos here at the bottom when you're on your hero page, you know here you guys secondary CTA is whatever it is but like a screenshot. So have basically like the column was every single field which is inside the air table on a CRO table needs to be also inside the customer portal basically. Does that sound good? Gotcha. And same principle really for technical SEO. Like that's exactly the same principle. There's also a field with like a. Sorry, no screenshot for techno SEO. But there's also just like similar fields in terms of like data et cetera. 
J
Jules Davies
31:52
That and then after brief approvals, I mean all of this basically is mainly a question of like adding more fields most of the times I'd say. 
J
Jules Davies
32:03
Just. 
J
Jules Davies
32:03
One heads up as well. For the content board I'm probably guessing, sorry, the content workflow, the articles 1. This will probably have quite a few fields and you'll probably need to have the potential to slide the slider right in terms of seeing quite a few because usually it will be a board which clients use end to end. So a rough understanding of this is the whole content production board, their whole pipeline across the whole campaign. So often they'll be going from left to right like sense. They won't just be focused on the content part. They'll also be interested in terms of like knowing, okay, this one's actually live. Oh, this one's like doing images. So there's actually a lot of fields in. Basically there's not just like five that's. 
K
Kimberley Hamon
32:43
This is something like we literally talked about this yesterday about the. Is the status. Because like I thought that we wanted to show. Show to the client only the stages that was relevant to them because like. Yeah, but it's going to be very long if we show the whole. 
J
Jules Davies
33:08
We have to show the part with the briefs and the keyword selection, but we definitely need to show them apart from all the way from the content production to also through the images, all the way down to publication basically. And also like in sound linking. Because the clients often they like to see that because if basically part of their workflow as well in terms of saying so has the image been created? Have it created? I don't know what. And you know, it's like if you look at Corona pos here, I mean obviously a few fields on them are hidden, but like if you take from. Let's have a look here, take the Content Management board. Okay, so all the blue part here we don't need, all the purple part we don't need. 
J
Jules Davies
33:45
But all the yellow part here, a bunch of fields and then even like the ready. The upload part and then the internal linking all the way through to the uploading basically. So there's like I don't know, 5, 10, 13. Thirteen fields roughly. So it's a bit more than just four or five, basically. That's what I'm trying to say. Does that make sense? 
K
Kimberley Hamon
34:06
Yeah. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
34:07
Cool. 
J
Jules Davies
34:08
Just because clients usually like to have all that information there, basically. So cool, let's do that. Awesome. Yeah, I was just wanting to there and then trying to think it has the main part. So I'll do some stuff in terms of like UI ux, you know, just like little stuff like for example the wrapping of titles, I think that needs to be wrapped for example, so the sort of breaks in design. There's a few stuff on like the cards, how much information is shown. But yeah, I mean overall it's. It started in a really good spot I'd say as a whole. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
34:40
So probably have to like make the cards smaller as well. If we add like more statuses in here. 
J
Jules Davies
34:46
Well, could we just have a table? Sorry, not table, but like a Board with scrollable. Because I just do that. I think if you make the cards too small, it'll probably be too small to read. So I'd say leave. I mean, this is a good, like. How'd you call it? Spacing, I'd say. But like we just had like a table. Not a table, like a scrollable view where you can sort of scroll across the board. That'd be great. I'd say. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
35:09
Okay. 
J
Jules Davies
35:10
Yeah. 
J
Jules Davies
35:11
Extra comment as well was to maybe like, if you want to, you know, inside editor, we have this feature. I don't know if they have it here or inside notion. Sometimes you have the feature. It's possible, but like you can also just like have a color and that way you can sort of like color code the columns and it sort of helps you understand roughly better which is which stage and it just helps a little bit better in terms of ui. But it's not the end of the world. But if possible make life easier. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
35:34
Yep, for sure. 
J
Jules Davies
35:38
Cool. 
J
Jules Davies
35:39
But yeah, there you go. That was briefly. I take the. Take the hand there, Mike. I'll let you take the lead if you want to. If you had any extra ideas that you wanted to cover yourself from our. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
35:51
Side, like the main questions was about the onboarding form. So now we got that covered, we're gonna set it up for you. And I would say that right now I think we have already two or three pages set up like with the backend connections. So in terms of the next steps, probably going to start sharing per page to you also so you could take a look also after we make those updates that we discussed about today. So you can kind of start taking a look at page by page, all the workflows and everything, how it looks like and also share the airtable with you. We can also transfer it over to your workspace, their table base since we have like most of the data in there and then the table set up. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
36:39
So I think from next week we'll probably start going over all the pages like page by page and confirm everything. Probably going to come to reporting and the KPI dashboard like the last since there's a lot of different elements in there. So that's kind of support plan going forward. 
J
Jules Davies
36:56
Okay, cool. All right, awesome. Sounds good. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
36:59
All right. 
J
Jules Davies
37:01
But. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
37:02
But nothing else from my side. 
J
Jules Davies
37:03
Okay. Kim, do you have anything else? You're all good? All good. Okay, cool. Bye. Many thanks, Mike. Yes, look going really good. So super grateful. Yeah, big thanks for all the work. 
K
Kimberley Hamon
37:15
Thank you. Bye. 
M
Mihkel Sinikas
37:16
Thanks guys. Take care. 
J
Jules Davies
37:17
Pleasure. Have a good day. Yeah. Tonight it.
